# Cuckoo Agent. We can't really intercept any inter-VM communication from the
# host / gateway so in order to dump traffic between VMs we have to use a
# different network dumping approach. For this machine we use the "nictrace"
# functionality from VirtualBox (which is basically their internal tcpdump)
# and thus properly dumps inter-VM traffic.
